# Enhanced Scanning Pattern-based Imaging Neural Network: ESPINNet

This repository contains an Enhanced Scanning Pattern-based Imaging Neural Network (ESPINNet) for grating interferometry and speckle tracking methods, which is based on a multi-resolution analysis of convolutional neural networks and can extract multi-contrast information including transmission, phase and dark-field.
